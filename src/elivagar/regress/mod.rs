//! `brokkr regress` - the two-archive semantic diff (tier-3 attribution).
//!
//! Native brokkr code over the linked elivagar crate since the corpus redesign;
//! it used to shell out to `elivagar regress`, which no longer exists. brokkr
//! owns the adjudication, elivagar owns the pipeline and the decode surface.
//!
//! What it computes: a semantic diff of two PMTiles archives (MVT + gzip only).
//! Every tile is reduced to a canonical form - layers sorted, features sorted,
//! merged-feature components sorted - which erases intra-layer feature order and
//! nothing else. That one dimension is the only thing the pipeline deliberately
//! leaves unconstrained across archives: within a run, record order is total, so
//! two builds of the same commit are byte-identical; two builds of *different*
//! commits can legitimately reorder features (a paint-rank table change, say)
//! with no semantic difference, and that is what the canonicalization absorbs.
//! Everything surviving it is classified - tiles/layers added or removed, extent
//! mismatches, missing/added features, bit-exact attribute changes, and
//! matched-feature geometry moves split into tolerance vs structural.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no comparability gate** and no baseline registry.
//! regress reads no provenance contract by design - it is the attribution
//! instrument, and its legitimate uses include cross-contract comparisons
//! (adjudicating artifact-active vs computed output, pricing an intended config
//! change). A hard refusal here would block those and push people back to a raw
//! spelling that no longer exists. Comparability is the caller's
//! responsibility; `brokkr pmtiles-inspect` reads the provenance blocks, and a
//! cross-variant comparison reports six-figure diffs on two correct builds.
//!
//! The standing output gate is `brokkr pmtiles-corpus check`, not this.
