# TODO

## Won't fix

### Inconsistent path-to-string conversion
All paths are constructed from known UTF-8 components, so `.display().to_string()` won't corrupt in practice. 100+ occurrences across 30+ files — not worth the churn.

### Hand-rolled UUID via `/dev/urandom`
10 correct lines in `src/db.rs`. Not worth adding the `uuid` crate as a dependency.

### `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` proliferation
Functions genuinely need many parameters. `BenchContext` covers the common case; remaining allows are the pragmatic choice.

## Backlog

### `bench tilemaker` stub

`src/elivagar/bench_tilemaker.rs` is 18 lines that immediately return an error.

Requires new infrastructure in `tools.rs` (tilemaker build, shortbread config, EPSG:4326 ocean shapefiles, ogr2ogr reprojection).

### `pmtiles-stats`

Rust rewrite of elivagar's `scripts/pmtiles-stats.py` (181 lines). New subcommand `brokkr pmtiles-stats <file>`.

**PMTiles v3 format parsing:**
- 127-byte fixed header: magic bytes, version, root directory offset/length, metadata offset/length, leaf directories offset/length, tile data offset/length, addressed/tile/entry counts, tile type, tile compression.
- Directory entries: varint-encoded (tile_id delta, run_length, length, offset delta). Varints are LEB128-style unsigned integers.
- 4 compression formats for tile data: none, gzip, brotli, zstd. The stats tool reads the header to report compression type, doesn't need to decompress.

**Output**: tile count, total size, min/max/avg tile size, zoom level distribution, compression type, metadata summary. Match the Python tool's output format.

**Dependencies**: None beyond std. PMTiles header is a fixed struct, varints are trivial to decode, and we're just computing stats not decompressing tiles.
